## Setup your development environment

Learn how to update your docs locally, set up your frontend repo, and deploy your changes.

### Documentation setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview documentation changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Frontend setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Clone the frontend repository">
    Clone the frontend repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/awesome-frontend.git
    cd awesome-frontend
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="box" title="Install dependencies">
    Install the project dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```
    Note: We're using `--force` to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="play" title="Run the development server">
    Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start your React application, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Update your docs and frontend

Add content directly in your MDX files for documentation. For the frontend, you can update React components using JavaScript and style them with Tailwind CSS.
